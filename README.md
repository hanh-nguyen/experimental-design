## experimental-design
An analysis toolkit to help answer questions:
- what is the minimum size for an A/B test?
- What is the confidence interval of a proportion or a mean?
- Is the difference between control and test conversion rates statistically and practically significant?

I also introduced different approaches to answer those questions, including inferential statistics and simulation.
